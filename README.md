# Summary

- `SQL92-JSON` is based on SQL92 standard, which is too old and having few updates, the latest SQL standard is [SQL2016](https://www.iso.org/standard/63555.html)

- `florajs/sql-parser` doesn't work in my machine, occurring console errors

- Both `js-sql-parser` and `node-sql-parser` works for me, and the results make sense. While the latter one wins more reputaion from Github.

- `codegen` is not complete open source
